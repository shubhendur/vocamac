## 🏛️ Why WhisperKit?

VocaMac uses [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) instead of raw whisper.cpp because:

| | WhisperKit | whisper.cpp |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| **Language** | Pure Swift (native) | C++ (requires bridging) |
| **Apple Silicon** | CoreML + Neural Engine | Metal only |
| **SPM Integration** | One-line dependency | Complex vendoring |
| **Model Format** | CoreML (optimized per device) | GGML (generic) |
| **Streaming** | First-class async/await | Manual threading |
| **Quality** | Same OpenAI Whisper models | Same OpenAI Whisper models |
| **Maintenance** | Argmax Inc. (commercial) | Community |

Same accuracy, dramatically better Apple platform integration.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS 13 (Ventura)** or later
- **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- **Xcode 15+** or Swift 5.9+ (only for building from source)

### Permissions

VocaMac requires three macOS permissions:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| **Microphone** | Capture your voice for transcription |
| **Accessibility** | Global hotkeys and text injection into apps |
| **Input Monitoring** | Detect hotkey presses system-wide |

> **Note:** After granting Input Monitoring, a restart of VocaMac is required for it to take effect.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Download DMG (Recommended)

1. **Download** the latest `VocaMac-x.x.x-arm64.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac/releases)
2. **Open** the DMG and drag VocaMac to Applications
3. **Remove quarantine** (required because VocaMac is not yet notarized with Apple):
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/VocaMac.app
   ```
4. **Open** VocaMac from Applications (right-click → Open on first launch)
5. **Grant permissions** — Microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring when prompted

### Option 2: Build from Source (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac.git
cd vocamac
make install
```

This builds VocaMac, installs it to `/Applications`, and launches it. Permissions are granted directly to VocaMac — just like the DMG method.

### Option 3: CLI Commands (For Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac.git
cd vocamac
make install-cli
```

This installs two commands to `~/.local/bin`:
- `vocamac &` — Launch VocaMac in background
- `vocamac-build` — Rebuild from source after pulling updates

> **Permissions note:** In CLI mode, macOS assigns permissions to your **terminal app** (Terminal, iTerm2, etc.) rather than VocaMac itself. Grant Microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring to your terminal app instead.

### First Launch

1. **VocaMac appears in your menu bar** (microphone icon, no Dock icon)
2. **Grant permissions** — Microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring (see [Permissions](#permissions) above)
3. **First model download** — WhisperKit automatically downloads the recommended model for your device (~40–500 MB depending on hardware)
4. **Start dictating** — Hold the **Right Option** key, speak, and release. Your words appear at the cursor!

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Push-to-Talk (Default)

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|-------------|
| **Hold Right Option** | Recording starts (menu bar icon turns red) |
| **Speak** | Audio is captured locally |
| **Release Right Option** | Recording stops → transcription → text injected at cursor |

### Double-Tap Toggle

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|-------------|
| **Double-tap Right Option** | Recording starts |
| **Speak** | Audio is captured |
| **Double-tap Right Option again** | Recording stops → transcription → text injection |

Switch between modes in **Settings → General → Activation**.

---

## 🧠 Whisper Models

VocaMac uses OpenAI Whisper models via WhisperKit's CoreML format. The app auto-detects your hardware and recommends the best model:

| Model | Parameters | Size | Speed | Quality | Best For |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Tiny** | 39M | ~0.4 GB | ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ | Good | Quick notes, older Macs |
| **Base** | 74M | ~0.8 GB | ⚡⚡⚡⚡ | Better | Daily use on 8GB Macs |
| **Small** | 244M | ~1.5 GB | ⚡⚡⚡ | Great | 16GB+ Apple Silicon |
| **Medium** | 769M | ~2.5 GB | ⚡⚡ | Excellent | 24GB+ for high accuracy |
| **Large v3** | 1550M | ~4.8 GB | ⚡ | Best | Maximum accuracy |

Models are downloaded automatically from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml) on first use and cached locally. Download additional models from **Settings → Models**.

---

### Build Commands

```bash
make install        # Build + install to /Applications (recommended)
make install-cli    # Install CLI commands to ~/.local/bin
make build          # Build .app bundle in repo root (dev iteration)
make test           # Run tests
make run            # Launch the locally built .app
make clean          # Remove build artifacts
make help           # Show all commands
```

### Uninstall

To completely remove VocaMac and all its data (downloaded models, preferences, caches):

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

Use `--keep-build` to preserve build artifacts:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh --keep-build
```

### Troubleshooting

**Reset onboarding:** To re-trigger the first-launch onboarding wizard (e.g., after an upgrade or for testing), reset the onboarding flag:

```bash
defaults delete com.vocamac.app vocamac.hasCompletedOnboarding
```

Then relaunch VocaMac. This only clears the onboarding state — all other preferences (hotkey, language, model) are preserved.

**Reset all preferences:** To start completely fresh:

```bash
defaults delete com.vocamac.app
```

**Reset permissions after updating:** When updating VocaMac to a newer version, it's recommended to reset permissions first so the new binary gets a clean grant. You can do this from **Settings → Debug → Reset All Permissions**, or manually via Terminal:

```bash
tccutil reset All com.vocamac.app
```

This clears all permission entries (Microphone, Accessibility, Input Monitoring) for VocaMac. On next launch, macOS will prompt you to re-grant them for the new version. This avoids stale permission entries that point to an old binary's CDHash.

## 🌐 Cross-Platform

VocaMac is the macOS member of the Voca family:

| Platform | Project | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
|  Linux | [VocaLinux](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux) | ✅ Available |
|  macOS | [VocaMac](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac) | 🚀 Beta |
| 🪟 Windows | [VocaWin](https://vocawin.com) | 📋 Planned |

Each platform uses native technologies for the best possible integration, while sharing the same UX patterns and Whisper model family.

- [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) - Original Whisper model

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Permissions reset on rebuild** — Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions reset on every rebuild (see below).
- **First launch requires internet** — WhisperKit downloads the speech recognition model on first run. All subsequent launches work fully offline.
- **macOS only** — Requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.

### Why Do Permissions Reset on Every Rebuild?

macOS tracks Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions using the app's **CDHash** (a cryptographic hash of the code signature), not the bundle identifier. When you rebuild VocaMac with ad-hoc signing (`codesign --sign -`), the binary changes, producing a new CDHash — so macOS treats it as a completely new, untrusted app.

This is **not a bug** — it's macOS security by design, preventing modified apps from inheriting sensitive permissions. All open-source macOS apps that use Accessibility (Rectangle, Maccy, AltTab, etc.) have the same limitation.

**Why Microphone permission persists:** Microphone access uses AVFoundation's framework-level preference cache with relaxed verification, unlike the strict CDHash checks for Accessibility and Input Monitoring.

**Workarounds:**

| Approach | How | Permissions Persist |
|---|---|---|
| **Reset permissions on update** | Settings → Debug → Reset All Permissions (or `tccutil reset All com.vocamac.app`) | Recommended before each update |
| **Re-grant manually** | System Settings → Privacy & Security after each rebuild | Per rebuild |
| **Run from Terminal** | Grant permissions to Terminal.app once, then run `make run` or `.build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/VocaMac` | ✅ Always |
| **Developer ID signing** | Requires Apple Developer Program ($99/year) — planned for future releases | ✅ Always |

> **💡 Developer tip:** Add your Terminal app (Terminal.app or iTerm2) to both Accessibility and Input Monitoring in System Settings. Then run VocaMac directly from Terminal — permissions are inherited and never reset.
