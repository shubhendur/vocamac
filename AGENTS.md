# VocaMac — AI Coding Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview

VocaMac is a **native macOS menu bar application** for local voice-to-text dictation, built with **Swift 5.9+** and **SwiftUI**. It uses **WhisperKit** (CoreML-based) for on-device speech recognition. The project also includes a **static marketing website** (`web/`) deployed to GitHub Pages at [vocamac.com](https://vocamac.com).

- **License:** AGPL-3.0
- **Minimum target:** macOS 13 (Ventura)
- **Build system:** Swift Package Manager
- **CI:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Website deployment:** GitHub Pages via release trigger (`.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml`)

---

## Critical Rule: Use Git Worktrees for Parallel Tasks

**When asked to perform multiple unrelated tasks simultaneously, ALWAYS use git worktrees.**

```bash
# Create worktrees in /tmp — never pollute the main workspace
git worktree add /tmp/vocamac-<task-name> -b <branch-name> main

# After work is complete, clean up
git worktree remove /tmp/vocamac-<task-name>
git worktree prune
```

**Why:** Concurrent work on the same directory causes branch conflicts, overwritten files, and corrupted state. Each worktree gets its own isolated copy of the repo on its own branch.

**Rules:**
- Create worktrees in `/tmp/` with the prefix `vocamac-`
- One worktree per branch, one branch per PR
- Always prune worktrees after pushing and creating PRs
- Never modify files in the main workspace when worktrees are active for that task

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build (debug)
swift build

# Build (release)
swift build -c release

# Run tests
swift test

# Build app bundle (creates VocaMac.app)
./scripts/build.sh

# Install via script
./scripts/install.sh
```

The project builds on **macOS only** (requires AppKit, CoreML, AVFoundation). CI runs on `macos-15`.

## Code Style & Best Practices

### Swift Conventions
- Use **SwiftUI** for all views — no AppKit views unless absolutely necessary for system integration
- Use **`@Observable`** (or `ObservableObject` with `@Published`) for state management
- Prefer **`async/await`** over callbacks and closures for asynchronous work
- Use **`guard`** for early returns; avoid deep nesting
- Follow Apple's [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use meaningful names: `isRecording` not `flag`, `audioLevel` not `val`
- Mark sections with `// MARK: -` for organization
- Add doc comments (`///`) on all public types, methods, and non-trivial private methods

### Architecture Patterns
- **Single source of truth:** `AppState` is the central observable state object
- **Service layer:** Business logic lives in `Services/` (AudioEngine, WhisperService, etc.)
- **Views are thin:** Views observe state and dispatch actions — no business logic in views
- **Dependency injection:** Pass dependencies via `@EnvironmentObject` or init parameters

### Error Handling
- Never force-unwrap (`!`) unless the value is guaranteed (e.g., system symbols)
- Use `do/catch` with meaningful error types
- Surface errors to the user via `AppState.appStatus = .error` with clear messages
- Log errors with `print()` (we don't have a logging framework yet — use descriptive prefixes like `[AudioEngine]`, `[WhisperService]`)

### Performance
- This is a **menu bar app** — it must be lightweight and responsive
- Avoid unnecessary polling; prefer event-driven updates
- `ProcessMonitor` polls every 5 seconds — don't add more frequent timers
- Heavy work (transcription, model loading) runs on background threads
- UI updates must dispatch to `@MainActor`

---

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- **All new logic must have corresponding tests** in `Tests/VocaMacTests/`
- Test file naming: `<ClassName>Tests.swift` (e.g., `WhisperServiceTests.swift`)
- Use **XCTest** framework
- Run tests with `swift test` — this is what CI executes

### What to Test
- Model logic and state transitions in `AppState`
- Service layer methods (parsing, formatting, validation)
- Data model encoding/decoding
- Edge cases: empty input, nil values, boundary conditions

### What NOT to Test
- SwiftUI view rendering (no snapshot tests currently)
- System APIs (microphone, accessibility, pasteboard) — these require real hardware
- WhisperKit internals — that's a third-party dependency

---

## Website (`web/`)

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS** — no build tools, no frameworks, no npm
- Served as static files from the `web/` directory
- Deployed to GitHub Pages on release via `.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml`
- Custom domain: `vocamac.com` (configured via `web/CNAME`)
- Logo: `web/logo.png` — SF Symbol `mic.fill` rendered in #007AFF (Apple system blue)
- Supports light/dark theme toggle
- Test locally: `cd web && python3 -m http.server 8080`

---

## Git & PR Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feat/<description>` — new features
- `fix/<description>` — bug fixes
- `ui/<description>` — UI/UX improvements
- `chore/<description>` — maintenance, config, tooling
- `docs/<description>` — documentation updates
- `ci/<description>` — CI/CD changes

### Commit Messages
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
```
feat: add CPU monitoring to popover panel
fix: menu bar icon not showing colored states
ui: enlarge popover panel for Retina displays
docs: update README badges
chore: change license to AGPL-3.0
ci: add GitHub Actions build workflow
```

### Pull Requests
- One logical change per PR — don't bundle unrelated changes
- Write descriptive PR titles and bodies
- PRs must pass CI (`swift build` + `swift test`) before merge
- Squash merge preferred for clean history

## Key Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) | On-device speech-to-text via CoreML | 0.9.4+ |

Keep dependencies minimal. This app values being lightweight and self-contained.

---

## macOS-Specific Considerations

- **Entitlements** (`VocaMac.entitlements`): App uses microphone access and accessibility APIs
- **LSUIElement:** App runs as a menu bar agent (no dock icon)
- **Code signing:** Ad-hoc signing for development; entitlements must be re-applied on each build
- **Permissions:** Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions reset on every rebuild when ad-hoc signed
- **MenuBarExtra limitations:** The label only renders `Image` or `Text` — custom SwiftUI views like `Canvas` won't appear. Use `NSImage` with `isTemplate = false` for colored menu bar icons.

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **MenuBarExtra ignores SwiftUI colors** — Use `NSImage` with `sourceAtop` tinting and `isTemplate = false` for colored states
2. **`Canvas` doesn't work in menu bar** — It renders in popovers but not in `MenuBarExtra` labels
3. **Browser caches SVG/PNG aggressively** — When testing website changes, always hard refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R`)
4. **Accessibility permission resets on rebuild** — Expected with ad-hoc signing; document this for users
5. **WhisperKit model download** — First run requires internet to download the whisper model; all subsequent runs are offline
